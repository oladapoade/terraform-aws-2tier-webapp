# Terraform 2-Tier Web App on AWS

This project demonstrates how I deployed a 2-tier architecture (VPC, subnets, security group, and EC2 instance) using **Terraform** on **AWS**. It includes the setup, Terraform configuration, encountered challenges, and solutions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized using separate Terraform configuration files:

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Terraform**
- **AWS CLI**
- **Visual Studio Code** with **WSL (Ubuntu)** on Windows

---

### 12. Output Public IP via Terraform

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems I Faced & Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Terraform GitHub push permission denied to wrong user | I updated my GitHub config to use the correct email/account |
| SSH key permissions too open | Ran `chmod 400 my-key.pem` to restrict access |
| EC2 connection failed initially | Fixed by adding correct key name to EC2 resource and security group rule |
| Apache page not loading | Ensured Security Group allowed HTTP (port 80) & EC2 had public IP |

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

- Always verify your AWS credentials and Terraform backend before deployment.
- Managing infrastructure as code makes cloud resource provisioning repeatable and scalable.
- EC2 security requires both correct permissions and network config (VPC, routes, security group).
